# Developer Coding Challenge
Welcome to the developer coding challenge! This is a weekend coding exercise intended to give potential new developers a chance to show off their skills and impress us. Please completely read the instructions below before beginning your work.

## The Challenge
Provided below is a read-only connection string to a MongoDB instance.

`mongodb://dcc-user:d3v3l0p3rz!@dcc-cluster-shard-00-00-ofmz0.mongodb.net:27017,dcc-cluster-shard-00-01-ofmz0.mongodb.net:27017,dcc-cluster-shard-00-02-ofmz0.mongodb.net:27017/admin?readPreference=primary&ssl=true`

You should have access to a database called `dcc`, and within it a collection called `players`. Using the data in the `players` collection, we would like you to build a web application that:

* Displays a list of all players and their position (QB, WR, RB etc.)
* Allows users to search for a player within the list by name or position
* Allows users to view game logs for a selected player in the list


## Code
This is a full-stack Javscript excercise (unless otherwise instructed). If any required technologies were specified in the email you received, please make sure to incorporate those in your application.

* Write the code to complete the challenge
* Push it up to a public git repository. Please do not delete your code until we have had the chance to pull it.
* Send us the URL to your repository.

You have 48 hours from receipt of this document to complete the above requirements.

## Hints

* Make it look good, do your best to impress us and be creative
* Expect us to pull your code and test it
* Form is just as important as function (if your app works but your code is sloppy, it can be just as bad)
* Bonus points for hosting your app somewhere (AWS, Azure, GCP etc.)
